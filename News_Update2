<h2 style="font-size: 40px">&#9899;Delhi students stranded in Kota to arrive today</h2>
<p>The buses sent by the Delhi government to bring back around 800 Delhi students stranded in Kota will arrive early morning on Sunday.

Aam Aadmi Party leader, Satya Prakash Dubey said in a tweet: "Buses sent to Kota for bringing back the Delhi Students have left Kota for Delhi. Buses are expected to reach Kashmiri Gate at 5 in the morning. Students will be screened medically, after that DTC buses will drop them at their homes."

Around 40 buses of the Delhi Transport Coporation had reached Kota on Saturday morning to bring back the students. The buses will follow social distancing measures in their seating arrangements.

The buses will have a team of doctors and officials who will accompany the students.</p>

<img style="height: 200px; width: 400px" src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_960x540/HT/p2/2020/05/03/Pictures/london-mayor-boris-johnson_65a82778-8ccf-11ea-8bae-d48e751bd032.jpg">
<p>Doctors treating Boris Johnson for coronavirus prepared to announce his death after he was taken to intensive care, the British prime minister said on Sunday, in his first detailed comments about his illness.

“It was a tough old moment, I won’t deny it,” he was quoted as saying by the Sun on Sunday newspaper in an interview. “They had a strategy to deal with a ‘death of Stalin’-type scenario.

“I was not in particularly brilliant shape and I was aware there were contingency plans in place. The doctors had all sorts of arrangements for what to do if things went badly wrong.”

Johnson, 55, first announced he had contracted Covid-19 on March 27 but maintained he had only mild symptoms. Yet he failed to shake the illness after a week of self-isolation.</p>
<p>Johnson said the experience had made him more determined to fight the disease and get the country back to normal. He said he would announce a “roadmap” towards easing the lockdown restrictions imposed in late March later this week.</p>




 <h2 style="font-size: 40px">&#9899;WHO assures that the virus has 'natural origin'</h2>
<img style= "height: 200px; width: 400px" src="https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202005/Dr_Michael_Ryan-770x433.jpeg?KzkI3APxzg5UvxfPeryccZDO1BdZGK1i">

<p>World Health Organization Health Emergencies Programme Director Michael Ryan reiterated that the group believes the novel coronavirus is "natural in origin."

Dr Michael Ryan responded Friday to comments by US President Donald Trump, who said he has seen information that the virus may have emerged from a virology institute in China.

Ryan said WHO teams have listened "again and again" to many scientists who have looked at the gene sequences and the virus, "and we are assured that this virus is natural in origin."

Ryan said it was important to establish the natural host of the virus, which could help pave the way for a better understanding of it and ways to prevent and respond to future outbreaks.

On Thursday, Trump suggested he was confident that China's Wuhan Institute of Virology was at the origin of the coronavirus, before again criticizing WHO's early response to the outbreak.

Most scientists believe the virus emerged at a market in the Chinese city, linked to an animal that has not yet been identified.

The WHO's Emergency Committee on the Covid-19 outbreak recommended Friday that the outbreak remains an international public health emergency, its highest level of alert.</p>
    

<h2 style="font-size: 40px">&#9899;Donald Trump says ‘glad’ Kim Jong Un ‘is back, and well’</h2>
<img style="height: 250px; width: 500px" src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_960x540/HT/p2/2020/05/03/Pictures/donald-trump-kim-jong-un_0775b456-8ccd-11ea-8bae-d48e751bd032.jpg">
<p>US President Donald Trump said Saturday he was “glad” about the reappearance of Kim Jong Un and that the North Korea leader is apparently healthy.

“I, for one, am glad to see he is back, and well!” Trump tweeted, following Kim’s first public appearance in nearly three weeks after intense speculation that he was seriously ill or possibly dead.

North Korean state television showed Kim walking, smiling broadly and smoking a cigarette at what the North said was the opening of a fertilizer factory on Friday in Sunchon, north of Pyongyang.

Rumors about Kim’s health have been swirling since his conspicuous no-show at April 15 celebrations for the birthday of his grandfather, the North’s founder -- the most important day in the country’s political calendar.</p>

<p>His absence triggered a series of fevered rumors and unconfirmed reports over his condition.

Kim’s disappearance from public view came as Pyongyang’s talks with Washington over the North’s nuclear arsenal are at a standstill, despite three meetings between Kim and Trump.

If Kim had been incapacitated or dead, it would have increased uncertainty over the process.

Trump had downplayed reports of Kim’s poor health and possible demise.</p>
